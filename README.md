Welcome to Rateio.vercel.app

The digital split for your event.

## Summary

It is an App that splits the consumption expenses of events that you choose (parties, barbecues, dinners, etc...) and shares the price with people who participate in them.

## How it Works

### First Step

Create a name for your event and start to adding people.

Choose if the person pays something or not.

If this person paid something add the description of the expense and how much was it, and an icon to add it.

You can edit or delete the people from the list. If you don't need, move to the next step.

### Second Step 

Choose who participates in the expenses, and move to the result.

### Result

Here in the first section, you can see the split of the Expenses and who participate in that and who paid it.

Here in the second section the detailed expenses and how many is the debt or the credit for which person.

Here is a suggestion of "who can pay who", to split the expenses correctly.

And in the footer you have 2 buttons: 

The Edit button that you can EDIT your split going to the first Step.

The Share button creates a link to your result that you can share with the participants.


## For Development

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or

```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
